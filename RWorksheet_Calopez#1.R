#12. Statements can be grouped together using braces ‘{’ and ‘}’. A group of statementsis sometimes called a block. Single statements are evaluated when a new line is typed atthe end of the syntactically complete statement. Blocks are not evaluated until a new line is entered after the closing brace.
#Enter this statement:
{ x <- 0+ x + 5 + }
#Describe the output.
#ans. This line of code can't be run because there's an error. By removing the extra plus sign at the end of the equation changes the whole code. 

#13. *Set up a vector named score, consisting of 72, 86, 92, 63, 88, 89, 91, 92, 75, 75 and 77. To access individual elements of an atomic vector, one generally uses the x[i] construction.
# Find x[2] and x[3]. Write the R code and its output.

#14. *Create a vector a = c(1,2,NA,4,NA,6,7).
# a. Change the NA to 999 using the codes print(a,na.print="-999").

# b. Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.

print(a,na.print="999")

#output:  1   2 999   4 999   6   7
#this code replaces the NA to 999 and prints the vector a.

# 15. A special type of function calls can appear on the left hand side of the assignment operator as in > class(x) <- "foo". Follow the codes below:

name = readline(prompt="Input your name: ")
age = readline(prompt="Input your age: ")
print(paste("My name is",name, "and I am",age ,"years old."))
print(R.version.string)
# What is the output of the above code?
# The output above is "My name is Rey Angelo and I am 20 years old."
