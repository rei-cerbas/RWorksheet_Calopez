# The majority of the other sentiments on this day, July 14, are negative. This indicates that some subjects or occurrences generated negative attitude on that particular day.

# Even though all attitudes increased on this day, July 15, the negative sentiment is still at its greatest level. This suggests that something happened on that day that sparked unfavorable feelings.

# On these days, negative attitudes are still prevalent on July 17 and July 18, but neutral and positive sentiments are largely unchanged.

# On July 20, all sentiments reached their lowest points, although there were still more negative feelings among the others. This indicates that nothing happened on that day.

# All emotions are higher on this day, July 21, with the negative still dominating. This could imply that on that particular day, something happened that prompted people to react negatively.

#This information can lead us to the conclusion that public opinion is subject to outside influences and changes over time.
